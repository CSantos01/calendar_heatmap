# Calendar Heatmap

This project allows you to extract events from Wikipedia pages and display them in a calendar heatmap.

## Usage

### Extracting events from Wikipedia

Use the script `events_extracter.py`. If you want to extract all events for each days and months, then use the script `calendar_extracter.py`.

### Displaying events in a calendar heatmap

The script `create_calendar.py` creates csv files summarizing the events for each day and month, as well as csv files ranking the average and the standard deviation of the number of events for each day and month. The script `calendar_heatmap.py` displays the calendar heatmap.
